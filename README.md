# Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains my practices in Reinforcement Learning. I have used **RL** for **Deep Neural Networks**. I have used **OpenAI** gym to create my Custom Environment.

## Environment 1
Environment 1 is a deep neural network to classify **MNIST** dataset. I have used **RL** to find the optimum Deep Neural network to classify digits in mnist dataset. This architecture can find the best number of convolution pooling layers to gain the highest accuracy for classification.

It is implemented using:
- Python
- Keras
- OpenAI gym
- CircleCI v2 configuration

## Environment 2
Implementation is not finished yet and it will be available soon. I am using **RL** for hierarchical clustering. This work will be published soon and the source will be available here. The original code that I have implemented is in **MATLAB** and currently I am implementing it in pure **tensorflow**.
